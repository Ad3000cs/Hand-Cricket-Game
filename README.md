RULES FOR NORMAL ODD EVE

1. Choose odd or eve (toss)
2. If the toss is in your favour, then chose bat or bowl. If the toss is not in your favour then you have to do what the computer asks you to.
3. If it’s your batting (say), choose any number from 0 to 10, if it matches the number with computer (who is bowling) then you are out. If it doesn’t then the runs keep adding till all 20 chances are consumed.
4. If you get out or your chances are over then the computer will try and chase your score down. If it succeeds then computer wins, else you win.
